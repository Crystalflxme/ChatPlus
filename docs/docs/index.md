# Simple, easy, useful.
ChatPlus allows developers to easily use Robloxâ€™s [Lua Chat System](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Lua-Chat-System) without the hassle of setting it all up themselves.

Here are some of the system's features:

- Fully customize what a chat message shows up as in your game in a short time span
- Set specific users to have their own chat formatting
- Assign complex formatting for groups such as: rank specific formatting, ranges of ranks, and formatting to be applied to all members
- Setup a custom system/server message with your own formatting
- A [built in module](api/speakerplus.md) for easily creating your own custom [ChatSpeakers](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Lua-Chat-System/API/ChatSpeaker)
- [Client sided settings](setup/dynamic-client-chat-options.md) to dynammically control things like BubbleChat at any time needed
- Ability to have special formatting for gamepass owners
